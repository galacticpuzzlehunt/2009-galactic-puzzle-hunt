  Summed up, a quite obviously taxing, difficult and pure meta with just a
  puzzle title, key to breaking it. 
  <br><br>
  The answers to the puzzles in this year&rsquo;s hunt are:
  <br><br>
  <table style="table-layout: fixed">
    <tr><td>Something&rsquo;s Missing</td><td>D SHARP</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Rage Comics</td><td>AHHHHHH</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Voter Base</td><td>NEW TESTAMENT</td></tr>
    <tr><td>The Super Bowl</td><td>DOWN</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Primal Force</td><td>OPTIMUS</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Stationary</td><td>POLAR EXPRESS</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Misplaced Radicals</td><td>JOKER</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Holmes&rsquo; Yellow Hibiscus Bath</td><td>WAIANAE TUB</td></tr>
    <tr><td>High Expectations</td><td>BREATHE</td></tr>
    <tr><td>lolcatic trendsetters</td><td>CRAB BATTLE</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Final Battle of Final Fate</td><td>DUELED</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Commemorate</td><td>THE</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Alphabet Soup</td><td>SOCIETY FOR THE PRESERVATION AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF BARBERSHOP QUARTET SINGING IN AMERICA</td></tr>
  </table>

  Indeed, this meta does not contain any flavortext or shell and we are just
  left with the answers in some order. Fortunately the title tells us what to do
  &mdash; indeed, the title is key to breaking it! In particular, the title is
  pangrammatic, meaning that we can create a key containing all of the letters
  in the alphabet, with the first occurrences of each letter:
  &ldquo;sumedpaqitobvlyxngfcrwhjzk&rdquo;. Next, we should use the
  &ldquo;Summed Up&rdquo; part. Converting each letter to a number in the
  natural S=0 K=25 order, we may add up these numbers. (For example, consider
  the answer &ldquo;THE&rdquo;. T=9, H=22, and E=3. So their sum is 34.) Of
  course, some numbers will be larger than 25. The natural thing to do with
  these numbers is to take mod 26 (for example, 34 mod 26 is 8) in order to
  ensure that all of our numbers are small enough in order to convert these
  numbers back to letters, for which we can once again use the same key. (For
  example, 8 converts back to I.) This gives us, in puzzle order, <b>PICK THE
  THE MIX</b>, indicating that the item we need from the trash heap to find
  WALL&middot;E is the <i>cassette tape</i>.
  <br><br>
  As a side note, this meta answer is extremely thematic because our meta
  mechanism involves picking letters from a length 26 string, mixing letters in
  an answer does not affect extraction, and the word the appears three times in
  the answers. Unfortunately, <i>I wasn&rsquo;t able to fit three the&rsquo;s in
  my answer</i> since we only had time to write 13 puzzles this year.
  <br><br>
  Teams that successfully retrieved the cassette tape were invited to this
  year&rsquo;s in-person runaround on location in outer space. Please
