  <hr>
  Obviously, when you first open this puzzle, you are greeted with a series of
  quotes from Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s magnum opus <i>The Dark Knight</i>.
  You&rsquo;ll quickly notice that a single word in each of these quotes has
  been changed.
  <br><br>
  A truly astute solver will look at the groups of words that have been
  replaced, along with the original words:
  <ul>
  <li>&ldquo;...heart/dry...&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;...knife/dot...&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;...dog/clan...&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;...face/slave...&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;...old/skin...&rdquo;</li>
  </ul>
  From here, it&rsquo;s a trivial realization that the only place all of these
  words appear is in the list of Kangxi radicals (as hinted at in the flavor 
  text of the puzzle), characters used in Chinese writing. Not only does each
  word correspond to a specific character, but these characters are numbered
  from 1 to 214. If you &ldquo;spot the difference&rdquo; by subtracting one
  from the other, you get the following numbers:
  <ul>
  <li>61 - 51 = 10</li>
  <li>18 - 3 = 15</li>
  <li>94 - 83 = 11</li>
  <li>176 - 171 = 5</li>
  <li>125 - 107 = 18</li>
  </ul>
  And, of course, when you convert these numbers back into letters (A=1, B=2,
  C=3...), you get <b>JOKER</b>, who is also the speaker of all the quotes
  involved. Clever, huh?
