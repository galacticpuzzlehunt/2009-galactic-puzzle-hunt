  <hr>
  This puzzle parodies the popular rage comics, and so the answer is naturally
  <b>AHHHHHH</b>. However, these scenes don&rsquo;t really make much sense. This
  is because they are actually all referencing Shakespearean plays, as hinted by
  the flavortext (which high IQ solvers will recognize as a reference to the
  Othello quote &ldquo;I understand a fury in your words / But not your
  words,&rdquo; which is exactly what these comics are.) Identifying the plays,
  you can easily extract the answer <b>AHHHHHH</b>.
  <br><br>
  The Plays (which is also the order of <b>AHHHHHH</b>):
  <ul>
  <li>Antony and Cleopatra
  <li>Henry IV part 1
  <li>Henry IV part 2
  <li>Henry V
  <li>Henry VI part 3
  <li>Henry VI part 2
  <li>Henry VIII
  </ul>

  As rage comics are all the rage these days, the team had a lot of fun envisioning scenarios in which the text was natural but unfortunately they all still turned out a bit artificial. My original idea was to make each panel reference a really obscure line from a scene of a play, so teams would need read the entire texts of plays to figure it out. This would reward the true Shakespeare fanatics who memorized not just Hamlet&rsquo;s soliloquy but also Jaques&rsquo; monologue. 
  <br><br>
  My interest in Shakespeare grew when my grandmother read Cymbeline to me as a bedtime story. She was a retired English teacher and Cymbeline was her favorite play. I was intrigued by the poetic language used and the complete mess of events that untangled itself. She read one scene to me each night and after we finished Cymbeline, I asked her to read me more Shakespeare. I later tried to read more modern playwrights but their writing was dull compared to the Bard. Because I started reading Shakespeare when I was 4, I aced all my high school English class Shakespeare units without even having to read them!
  <br><br>
  So, back to this puzzle, we discovered that the original idea was too constrained. It would use only the first letters of the plays, and unfortunately there weren&rsquo;t thematic answers that could be made with just the first letters. Furthermore, none of the scenarios made any sense at all, so we simplified the puzzle so that only the Comic Sans text in each puzzle referenced Shakespeare, while the Courier New text was just used to set the scene. 
  <br><br>
  Even with these changes to make it solvable, the editors also claimed that that version wasn&rsquo;t a real puzzle. I think it is and that they secretly hate Shakespeare, but I had to compromise. So, I ended up with this version of the puzzle, where the act/scene the line is from actually mattered. If you wrote out all the act numbers and scene numbers, you would notice that the acts are strictly monotonic and the scenes were also strictly monotonic, but one value out of the six would not fit the pattern. Everything took a downward turn when the math whizzes on the team told me that three panels wouldn&rsquo;t be enough to pick out a unique value as the misfit. 
  <br><br>
  I was ready to give up on writing the puzzle and have it replaced by a scavenger hunt. Everything was saved when someone pointed out that the last panel could be reinterpreted. If the last panel were interpreted as &ldquo;Act #F, Scene #U&rdquo;, using the number of each letter in the text of the panel, all of the comics would actually have a single value that&rsquo;s out of place. What a coincidence, huh? For example, in the first comic, the lines are from Act 1 Scene 2 (1.2), 2.3, 3.4, and the last panel is 1.5. The scene numbers go up and the act numbers almost go up except for the last 1. So you would take the first letter. It&rsquo;s not the most elegant puzzle but others say it&rsquo;s a more fun puzzle than before and it has a natural &ldquo;staircase&rdquo; extraction mechanism that is widely used in puzzlehunts, often being the first things teams try when they get a list of Shakespeare plays (as opposed to something like first letters). In the end, we didn&rsquo;t even get a chance to testsolve it but the Shakespeare connections were so solid and the extraction was so natural that we decided the puzzle was good. To make things worse, the rage comic generator website was down the night before our hunt so I couldn&rsquo;t remake anything even if I wanted to.
  <br><br>
  I haven&rsquo;t been able to include Shakespeare in a puzzle in years so I was excited to have this opportunity. Unfortunately for you Shakespeare fans, you probably did not stumble as you ran fast through the puzzle. I tried my best to make it fun for you, hope you enjoyed at least some of the references!
