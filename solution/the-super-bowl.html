  <hr>
  Even though this puzzle is blank, the title gives us an important clue.
  Because this puzzle is titled The Super Bowl, it makes sense to multiply the
  winning and losing team&rsquo;s scores, 27 and 23, to get 621, and then
  subtract their sum, 50, to get 571. Also, because the halftime show was so
  good, we take the total number of points scored before halftime, 24, and
  multiply that by 571 to get 13704. At this point, the solver might be a little
  stuck, but the next step is revealed by the classic strategy of thinking about
  what you haven&rsquo;t used yet in the puzzle: the team&rsquo;s regular season
  records! If you multiply the number of wins of the winning team by the number
  of wins of the losing team, we get 108, and subtracting the number of losses
  by (appropriately) the losing team, we get 101. Multiplying that by 13704
  gives 1384104. We&rsquo;re now in the home stretch: the final unused piece of
  information is in the touchdowns (the most important part of any football
  game!). We just need to take the number of touchdowns of the losing team and
  multiply that by 1384104 to get 4152312, and finally add the total number of
  teams playing the game, giving us 4152314. To extract, read pairs of digits as
  letters (with the usual 1=A, 2=B substitution and padding the odd-length
  number with a 0 at the beginning) to get the answer <b>DOWN</b>.
